# athletic_sales_analysis
This assisngment was about analyzing sales data. I focused on the cities in America that had the highest sales from 2020 to 2021. I combined the data into one data frame and changed the column names. Using groupby and the pivot function I was able to determind which region has the highest sales and also isolate the data to see how many women's shoes were sold.

I used Chat GPT and Xpert when I first started this assignment but when comparing my results with my brother, Kalvin Anglin, I realized I was doing more work and adjusted my input. I also used the solutions from the inclass assignments.
